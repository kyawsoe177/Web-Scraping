# Web Scraping from a Website

<p align="justify"> In this project, news headlines were scraped from the Business section of the BBC website using Python and the BeautifulSoup library. 
The script was designed to extract specific information from the webpage, including the headline, description, category tag, and the last updated timestamp. 
These elements were identified and retrieved using precise HTML tags and IDs. 
Once extracted, the data was organized and written into an Excel file, which was then saved locally on the device for further analysis or reference.</p>
